# DC-ShareRisk
A lightweight PowerShell tool that scans all Domain Controllers for non-standard SMB shares and detects insecure or misconfigured ACLs. Identifies unauthorized accounts, unsafe permissions, and risky share configurations that could expose a Domain Controller to security threats. No RSAT required — fully works with native .NET.
